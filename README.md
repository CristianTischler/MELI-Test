# Mercado Libre - Frontend Challenge

This is a project developed as part of a practical test for candidates applying for the front-end position at Mercado Libre. The application is a small interface that simulates searching for products on Mercado Libre, allowing users to search for products, view search results, and get more details about a specific product.

## Technologies Used

FrontEnd:

- React
- Typescript
- Sass

BackEnd:

- Node >= 18
- Express

## Functional Description

The application consists of three main views that allow users to interact with the product search platform:

Search Box: In this view, users can enter a search term to search for products. When the form is submitted, the application navigates to the search results view.

Search Results: Displays the products found based on the search term. 4 products are shown per page. Clicking on any product redirects to the product detail view.

Product Detail: Displays the complete details of a selected product, including the title, description, price, sold quantity, condition, and free shipping status.
